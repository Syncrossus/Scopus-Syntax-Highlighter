Scopus is a database of scientific articles that provides an advanced search function.

Due to the way it is implemented, it is often beneficial to edit the search queries in a file before submitting them.

This package provides syntax highlighting for the advanced search syntax, making typos much easier to spot and long queries easier to parse visually.
